# Flappy Bird Reinforcement Learning (Deep Q-Learning)
This project implements a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play Flappy Bird using Deep Q-Learning.

## Features
- Flappy Bird game implemented in Pygame
- Deep Q-Network (DQN) for training an AI agent
- Replay buffer for experience replay
- Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
- Automatic model saving and loading

## Installation

 - git clone https://github.com/dylan-savage/flappy-bird-ML.git
 - cd flappy-bird-ML
 - pip install -r requirements.txt

 ## Playing
 - To play manually run: python main.py
 - To train the agent: python agent.py
